    This is a injectable search bar that I developed for a client Fleetway travel.  It downloads an injector js file which then requests other css and javascript files to build the angular component.  Executing the search will take you to their site.

  <div
    style={
      Object {
        "marginBottom": "20px",
        "marginTop": "20px",
        "minHeight": "150px",
      }
    }
  >
    <search-widget />
    <Script
      attributes={
        Object {
          "id": "travelsmartInjector",
        }
      }
      onCreate={[Function]}
      onError={[Function]}
      onLoad={[Function]}
      url="https://bookings.fleetwaytravel.com/ng/injector.js?aid=fw"
    />
  </div>
  <p>
    The injector.js is vanilla javascript that creates additional script and css tags once it has been loaded.  Fleetway partner with other providers, each of which are given a particular identifier.  The injector.js also downloads an encrypted version of this for use in further api calls.
  </p>
  <p>
    The search bar itself is a combination of Angular 4 bootstrap and custom components, including a type ahead search, date range picker and other drop down controls.  It was designed to be flexible and reusable component.  It is included not only as an injectable widget, but also on the fleetway home page, as well as on multiple pages throughout their booking platform.
